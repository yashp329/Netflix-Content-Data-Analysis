# Netflix Content Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Netflix content, exploring trends and relationships between various parameters such as movie titles, box office collections, IMDb ratings, and user ratings. The project aims to gain valuable insights into the Netflix dataset and understand the patterns within the content library.

## Dataset

The Netflix dataset used in this analysis consists of 29 fields and 9425 records, providing crucial information about movies and TV shows available on the platform.

## Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Collection and Description**: The dataset fields and their definitions are thoroughly explained.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Unnecessary columns are dropped, missing values are handled, and categorical and numerical columns are merged to ensure data integrity.

3. **Data Manipulation**: Columns are renamed, new columns are created (e.g., "Release.Year", "Netflix.Release.Month"), and specific columns are selected for data summarization and visualization.

4. **Data Summarization**: Summary statistics are calculated to gain insights into the distribution of key rating metrics within the dataset.

5. **Formulating New Questions**: Additional questions are formulated to extend the scope of the analysis and explore new patterns.

6. **Data Visualization**: Various graphs and visuals, such as bar charts, pie charts, and clustered column charts, are plotted to visualize the findings and answer the formulated questions.

7. **Critical Discussion**: The choice of each visualization is justified based on its effectiveness in conveying the desired information.
